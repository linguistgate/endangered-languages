<h3 id="orgheadline2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Summary</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
The purpose of this project is to enable students to investigate a
specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_language">endangered language</a> of the world, tracing properties and facts
about the language and its speakers, reasons for its endangered status,
and possible solutions to the endangerment of this language as well as
others. Students will learn to use linguistically appropriate
terminology in discussing the language and its speakers; to identify
political and social causes of language endangerment; to derive reasons
for why linguistic diversity is important; and to propose solutions,
both small- and large-scale, to encourage linguistic diversity with
respect to their chosen language and, ultimately, to sociolinguistic
situations in their own community.
</p>

<p>
A major function of the project is to direct students toward a public
presentation of their research. They will learn to develop a research
plan and enact it, and they will demonstrate their knowledge and thought
process by presenting their findings using two modalities: visual (a
poster) and oral (an accompanying short speech and receptiveness to
answering audience questions).
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline4"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Public Exhibition</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The culmination of this project will be a poster and presentation
session to which members of the school and local community will be
invited. Students will display their information in a graphically
appealing, visually stimulating way using standard conference
posters. They will also be expected to give a short overview of salient
facts about their endangered language, in particular its geographical
location, the number of speakers, some fun facts about the language that
set it apart from English, and clear identification of some causes of
the erosion in the number of speakers of the language.
</p>

<p>
Students should be able to answer additional questions about potential
solutions to the language crisis, generate debate about the importance
of linguistic diversity, and respond to requests for more information
from attendees.
</p>

<p>
Taking a longer view, I envision students taking the results from this
initial public exhibition and applying for a Special Workshop Session at
the <a href="http://www.linguisticsociety.org/">Linguistic Society of America</a>'s Annual Meeting, held in a different
U.S. city each year. In January 2017, it will be held in Austin,
Texas. In 2018, it will be held in Salt Lake City, Utah. And in 2019, it
will be held in New York City. Given procurement of funding, students
would travel to this conference, present their information in a special
poster session, and interact with working linguists, some of whom are
actively engaged in language endangerment research and revitalization
efforts.

<h2 id="orgheadline7"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Learning Objectives</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
A central strength of using <b>linguistics in a high school classroom</b> is
that it touches on so many academic disciplines at once. This maintains
student interest by showing how complex and all-encompassing language is
in their daily lives. It also ensures that existing academic subjects
receive additional "support" via a linguistic point-of-view.
</p>

<p>
I summarize below both key knowledge areas and understanding, as well as
success skills, in particular the <b>academic mindsets</b>, that students
should develop and adopt.

<h2 id="orgheadline8"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Craft the Driving Question</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Despite the fact that there are more than 6,000 spoken languages on
Earth, many languages have very few speakers and risk dying out in the
next several generations. <b>What are some of these languages, what can
they teach us about language in general, what causes endangerment, and what solutions exist for maintaining linguistic diversity in the future?</b>
</p>

<p>
Each student should focus on choosing a single endangered language,
learning about its structure and speakers, identifying causes of
endangerment, and <b>discovering why linguistic diversity is important</b>
(with the important goal of trying to propose ways of solving some small
corner of the linguistic diversity crisis).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline9"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Plan the Launch</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
I envision this project as part of a linguistics course taught at the
high school level. I have material elsewhere devoted to issues of
motivation for teaching at high school, <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/language/v090/90.4.loosen.pdf">case studies of its
implementation in the United States and elsewhere</a>, and recruitment
strategies.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to envision the course operating within a digital
humanities course elective or even an English or foreign language
course, though additional work would have to be done on introducing
central linguistic concepts (accent, dialect, syntax, etc.).
</p>

<p>
I will engage students in the topic by providing audio and video samples
of various languages of the world, endangered and otherwise (Xhosa,
Hungarian, Cherokee, Basque, Icelandic, Gaelic, etc.). I will invite
them to reflect on what a language even is; what its uses are; how and
why languages differ from each other. In my experience, these are
fascinating topics for people of many different backgrounds and age
groups, and in-class discussion can be vigorous and revealing.
</p>

<p>
I will then play students samples or show them examples of endangered
languages and ask them to reflect on whether they think all of the
languages I have played will be alive in 100 years. I will invite them
to compare linguistic diversity with animal and plant diversity and
discuss reasons why loss of linguistic diversity might also be bad for
the planet and human society.
</p>

<p>
Endangered languages often have fun and interesting names, and this adds
to initial student interest in the topic.

I envision this as taking place within a larger curricular
framework. Students may have full time on some days to work, while on
others it may be 20&#x2013;30 minutes of classroom time. It will, however,
constitute the main homework for the course during the period.
</p>

<p>
Depending on class ability level, an additional week may be necessary
for research and editing.

<h2 id="orgheadline21"><span class="section-number-2">8</span> Student Voice and Choice</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
Students have opportunity at every stage of the project to express voice
and choice.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In initial weeks
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reflect on and give their own opinions and stories about language,
language use, and language endangerment</li>
<li>Choose their own language from a list based on their expressed interests
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A Choose Your Own Adventure model of answering 10 questions will
supply them with two or three possibilities.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How many languages do you speak?</li>
<li>Where is your family originally from?</li>
<li>Where do you hope to travel someday?</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The algorithm will ensure that there is no overlap among students.</li>
<li>Sadly, there are plenty of endangered languages for this to be possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Develop extensions to a template research plan</li>
<li>Ask questions to a guest linguist working on endangered languages</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In weeks two onward
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Engage in active research (Web, library, interviews) based on their
research plan</li>
<li>Identify problems with their research in their journaling</li>
<li>Track their research via the Wiki format</li>
<li>Engage with other students in teams that support each other's
research and motivation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In weeks four onward
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Design and begin construction of their own poster</li>
<li>Include, assimilate, or even reject feedback from team members,
instructor, and possibly other members of the faculty on ways to
improve their presentation and sharpen their visual and oral skills</li>
<li>Decide if they want to make their poster more "multi-dimensional"
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sound clips</li>
<li>Screen showing interviews with speakers</li>
<li>Books published in the language (dictionaries)</li>
<li>Artwork that reflects concerns about linguistic diversity</li>
<li>How they will dress and behave as presenters</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
More advanced students will be given greater leeway in their Wikis and
journals to decide how they want to continue their investigation and
present their results and findings; demonstrate visually and orally what
they have learned; and provide extensions to their work as they engage
with the public.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline22" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline22"><span class="section-number-2">9</span> Critique and Revision</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
Students are encouraged to be the first responders to critique and
revise their work. Daily journaling and the Wiki framework naturally
encourage reflection and re-planning.
</p>

<p>
I have built into the class schedule many opportunities for instructor
feedback at both the class and individual level. This will be done with
written expectations and suggestions, verbal discussions of how the
project could unfold and problems the student researcher is facing, and
most importantly, collaborative work on the Wiki between instructor and
student.
</p>

<p>
The journal is an important research tool that allows students to track
their own progress, revise as they go, and demonstrate growth as they
learn more about a complex topic.
</p>

<p>
The Wiki is in place to build a solid research foundation on their work,
with built-in assistance. It also will include guiding questions,
resources, and other materials that students can harness in case they
find themselves stuck. It lends itself naturally to revision because of
the very nature of Wikis.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, students will be organized into accountability groups in the
classroom. While they will be working on separate languages, they will
occasionally be required to explain aspects of their research to their
peers, and their peers are additionally required to provide feedback and
critique of work quality.
</p>

<p>
Final quality assurance rests with the student and instructor.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline23" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline23"><span class="section-number-2">10</span> Reflection</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
Weekly journal entries will ask for higher-level reflective responses on
the nature of research itself:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What is most challenging about research?</li>
<li>What specific problems were encountered and overcome this week?</li>
<li>What could be improved about the project itself?</li>
<li>What gaps in knowledge are apparent? What is being done to fill them,
or are they best left for the future?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline24" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline24"><span class="section-number-2">11</span> Differentiation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
<p>
As I mentioned in the calendar portion of this plan, some classes may
need more time than six weeks for roll-out, research, development, and
implementation of a coherent poster presentation. That is the best-case
scenario. It can easily take seven to ten weeks, especially if the class
has other material being taught during class time.
</p>

<p>
A particularly strong case for why linguistics makes sense in high
school is that it offers something to everyone: a math-inclined person can
develop quantitative skills in linguistics. A person inclined more to
poetry can explore aesthetic aspects of the language in question. There
is a wealth of directions a student can travel, and all of them are
productive.
</p>

<p>
This is true as well for ESL students, special-needs students, and
students with diverse learning styles. The Wiki and journal system
provides cohesion in the course and a set of universal requirements, but
within that framework, there is incredible room for student development
and growth.
</p>

<p>
Some students will require more feedback, more scaffolding, and more
help in finding resources. The accountability of the Wiki and the
journal provide a sure-fire, daily way for the instructor to track students'
progress and adapt in individual cases as needed. Of course, the
foremost goal of the course is to promote a "flexible learner," so
students should always be pushed to a reasonable standard, but no one
should fall through the cracks, especially with a project with such rich
possibilities for learners of so many different styles, backgrounds, and
abilities.
